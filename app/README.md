# Glass Presentation

A little experiment to see how feasible using Glass as a presentation remote/teleprompter is.

Very proprietary to my setup right now. Requires running a Node.js server, client, and only supports OSX right now. Feel free to take it and modify it as you see fit.

It's not really usable right now unless you know a bit of Android and Node, but if there's a lot of demand for it, I *might* make a web GUI for it...
